# Module-2-Challenge-Refactoring

##Overview 
  Our friend Steve reahced out to us about the initial analysis we did on his stock portfolio. He loved what we did but he wanted to see if there was a way for this code to analyze more data than what was initially provided, additionally he wanted to know if adding in additional data would affect how fast the code was able to execute. We took the original code we provided Steve and recfactored it to be more flexible as well as provide a print out of the run time to meet his new goal.
  
  ###Results 
    Our refactored code was more user friendly, having a pop up input for what year to analyze, and provided information on the run time of the code. The run time print out was important to our friend Steve because he needed to know how useful this code would be for much larger data sets. As we can see from the attached pictures, the code took only fractions of a second to run, which is a good indicator that we should be able to apply this code to larger data sets.

####Summary 
  Refactoring code has advantages and disadvantages. Because we already had code thats functionality was close to Steve's request it was easier to take that code and tweak it so that it would be applicable to Steve's new request; we didn't have to take the time to completely write a new sub routine for him. However, because we were reusing code there is a chance to carry over an irrelevant variable or a chunk of code that wouldn't be applicable for the refactored code's new purpose.
